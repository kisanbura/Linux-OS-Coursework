# Week 4 - **Initial System Configuratoin & Security Implmentation**
##

## Overview
This week focused on implementing foundational security controls on the Ubuntu Server. 
All configuration tasks were performed remotely via SSH from the workstation, in line 
with professional server administration practices. Key-based SSH authentication was 
configured, insecure access methods were disabled, a non-root administrative user was 
created, and a firewall was deployed to restrict network access.
